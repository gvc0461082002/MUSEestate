MUSE is built around being both minimal and functional.


## Installing

This version isn't complete and will require PostgreSQL among other things. Also theres a bunch of stuff still missing. Stay tuned :)

But if you *really* can't wait...

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/MUSEestate/MUSEestate.git`

2. change to the directory
3. run `bundle install`
4. edit config/database.yml if you wanna change from the default database settings...
5. create the database `rake db:create`
6. run the database migrations `rake db:migrate`
